<h2>Job recommandation</h2>
<p>Nowadays, hundreds of millions of jobs are posted on
LinkedIn, which is the home to countless job seekers and
employers. How to recommend and notify these jobs to the
job seekers who are interested and suited to correctly and
efficiently can be non-trivial. To realize this, a
classification distribution should be generated among all
job seekers in order to personalize their needs. Thus, what
we are working at is to use the personal description job
seekers posted on LinkedIn to classify them in different
domains. Then we can use the domain to recommend
related jobs to them. In addition to recommend jobs to
different people with different preferences, we also aim to
provide the user with some glance about their expected
income according to our domain suggestions. In a word, we
try to personalize work domain recommendations and
personalize salary prediction. For the Job category
prediction, the RNN model could predict in 0.9056. For the
salary prediction, the Regression Model has a test set
RMSE of 19.72.(10% approx). And besides we build a Web
UI for our system.</p>
